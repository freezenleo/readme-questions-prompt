  ## Description
  It is surely an annoying thing to do when comes to write a repo readme file. Therefore, I created this project readme generator for us to used after we finished our coding. It took me a lot of time to figure out how to use promise and what variables to define when I following the module. They just came from nowhere to me. But, here it is. I did it.
